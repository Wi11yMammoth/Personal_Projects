# Description (database-logger.py)

This is a simple program in which I record sense hat data, from a sense hat on a raspberry pi, and store it in a SQL database.
This program collects humidity, temperature, and pressure, and stores it in sensorDB.db. 

# Description (database-data-visualizer.py)

The data visualizer program reads the, temperature, humidity, and pressure, data in sensorDB.db and graphs it on screen for the user using
the matplotlib library. 

# Description (sensorDB.db)

This is an sqlite3 database with a table called sensor data. The set up is as follows:

sqlite3 sensorDB.db

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

CREATE TABLE sensordata(ID NUMERIC, tdate DATE, ttime TIME, temperature NUMERIC, humidity NUMERIC, pressure NUMERIC);

COMMIT;

.quit
