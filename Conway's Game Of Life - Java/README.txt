Conways game consists of a 2D grid of cells which are either alive or dead. 
The color of the cell indicates whether it is alive or dead. 

The game is played as follows.

A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


The code for this project is from Think Java Second Edition, by Allen B. Downey & Chris Mayfield.

I thought the program was cool so I coded it up. 


The code can be found in the ArchiveFile.zip java project
