# E-Commerce Project

## Description
This project was for a Java programming course I took in University.
The goal of this project was to create a program that simulates an online store in Java. The GUI was created using the Swing toolkit, and the program was tested using JUnit 5. This program simulates an online store that sells drinks.


## Installation
I created and ran this program using the IntelliJ IDEA. I Recommend using the same environment. You can download IntelliJ from Jet Brains https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/. Once you have IntelliJ installed you just need to load the E-Com Project folder.

## How to run the program
Assuming you are using IntelliJ you need to open the StoreView.java file. This file contains the main() function. IntelliJ has a green arrow beside this function you can click that to execute the program.

When you run the program you will be prompted with a message in the terminal window saying "Enter GUI y/n?". If you enter 'y' the GUI interface will load and you can interact with the program using the GUI. If you do not enter 'y' a command line interface in the terminal will load instead. So you can either use a GUI or the command line to use this program.
